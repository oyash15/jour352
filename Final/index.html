<h5> Dating in college is hard. With “situationships” having a huge moment and “hook-up” culture being all the rage, finding your person on campus can be difficult to say the least. This is where dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge come into play. <br><br>

With endless potential matches at the touch of your fingertips, what do students at the University of Maryland think about the effectiveness of these apps? Is it possible to find a true connection on your phone? We surveyed 36 anonymous UMD students who use dating apps, here’s what they think.

<p>83.3% of students surveyed are currently on Tinder. 69.4% are on Hinge and 44.4% are on Bumble. Under “other,” some students added in Grindr, Boo or Feeld as dating apps they use. This other category makes up a total of 14% of the data collected. <br><br>

Tinder and Hinge tied for the most popular among respondents, both earning 38.9% for students’ favorite dating app. Bumble received 19.4% and Grindr received 2.8%. <br><br>

Students enjoy that Hinge offers more of an opportunity to get a sense of someone’s personality before messaging them. Some also appreciate the fact that with Hinge, you can see if people “like” you first without having to like them back. <br><br>

“I love seeing their religion, political preference and hearing their voice, it just helps me see if we are a match,” one respondent said. <br><br>

<p>While Hinge may allow for more personable conversations, the benefits of Tinder, according to respondents, include its easy navigation and popularity on campus.  <br><br>

Students who said Tinder was their favorite cited reasons such as “it generally has cuter people that are also close” and “people actually send messages more often.” Plus, the “smash or pass” element of swiping makes for a fun game, as some commented. <br><br>

Bumble was the least popular among the big three, according to students polled. Despite some respondents sharing their appreciation for matches being time-sensitive, giving incentive and encouragement to actually send messages, overall it is not the top choice of most respondents.</p>

<br>


<blockquote class="pull-quote">
 	<strong>How else do these three apps compare?<br> One student summed it up:</strong> <br><br>
 “Hinge is too date-y and Tinder is too hook-up centered while on Bumble they’ll get coffee or a drink first but won’t want to commit.” 
 <br><br>
 <strong>Another shared that:</strong><br> “I like that girls talk first on Bumble, I like all the prompts on Hinge, but Tinder has the best looking people.”
</blockquote>

<h5> As for the intent behind downloading these apps in the first place, the most popular reason was to go on dates, with 58.3% of respondents selecting this as one of their reasons. Hooking up sat at second with 52.8%, while just messaging people earned 44.4%. Multiple people wrote in “because I’m bored” and “to play smash or pass” as other objectives. <br><br>

While many students tend to treat these applications as games, there is simultaneously a trend among students for a desire for genuineness. Many respondents said they look for profiles with personality or “a more realistic presentation of yourself rather than a cultivated appearance,” in the words of one student. <br><br>

Well, what makes for a “good” profile? According to respondents, providing a well rounded summary of who you are is vital, and not including any fishing or group photos is a plus too.

<p> At the end of the day, the biggest question is: Is it truly possible to find a long-term connection on a dating app? While 69.4% of respondents voted that it was possible, most backed it up by saying that it is rare.<br><br>

Some students were more cynical than others: “The apps focus mostly on looks, so it's hard to meet people that don’t care about superficial things.”<br><br>

Despite the challenges and some bad experiences, respondents ultimately shared positivity on this subject: “I think that going on an app where everyone's focus is on dating allows you to bypass the questioning that you have when meeting with people.”<br><br>

There are certainly a lot of fish in the sea. Sure, there are a lot of users who are creeps or simply not looking to commit, but according to our feedback, apps like Tinder, Hinge and Bumble do seem to help students put themselves out there and figure out what they are looking for.<br><br>

“Dating apps are a tool for connection! It may not be a meet-cute, but it’s possible to find good people this way.”</p>
